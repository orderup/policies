      </p>
      <h3><a name="modification">5. Modification</a></h3>
      <p>We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of these Terms of Use in our sole discretion. If

         Use page. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon our posting of the notice; provided that these

         constitute acceptance of these changes and the Terms of Use as modified.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="your-account">6. Your Account </a></h3>
      <p>You may only create and hold one account on the Site for your personal use and must register using a valid credit
         card. You are responsible for updating and correcting information you have submitted to create or maintain your
         account. As part of your account settings, you have the option to: (a) save, edit, or delete your personal
         information, including, without limitation, a valid credit card; and (b) opt-out of persistent login. You understand and
         agree that Groupon shall have no responsibility for any incident arising out of, or related to, your account
         settings. You must safeguard your password and supervise the use of your account. You are solely responsible for

         violation of these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, failure to maintain updated and correct information
         about your account (e.g., valid credit card information) will cause your account to fall out of good standing and we
         may cancel your account in our sole discretion. If your account is cancelled, you may forfeit any pending, current,
         or future account credits (e.g., Groupon Bucks), and any other forms of unredeemed value in your account. Upon termination, the
         provisions of these Terms of Use that are, by their nature, intended to survive termination (e.g., any disclaimers,
         all limitations of liability, and all indemnities) shall survive. We also reserve the right to change or discontinue
         any aspect or feature of our services or the Site, including, without limitation, requirements for use.

      <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer" target="_blank">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>,
         and simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to the following address: C T Corporation System, 208 S. LaSalle Street, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.

The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request, and/or the arbitrator determines, that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. In addition, you hereby unconditionally agree that (1) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the Site; (2) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (3) in the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, you and the applicable Groupon Entity(ies) shall agree to, or a court shall select, another arbitration provider.

      <p><b>(b) <u>No Class Action Matters</u>. We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our
         respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative
         proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual
         basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action and that the arbitrator may award relief (including injunctive relief) only on an individual basis. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary
         these provisions.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>(c) <u>Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial</u></b>. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (i) except
         with respect to a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, which you shall have the right to bring in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, you and Groupon agree that any Dispute may only be instituted in a state or federal court in Cook County, Illinois/Northern District of Illinois; (ii) you and Groupon irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes; and (iii) you and Groupon agree to waive any right to a trial by jury. You and Groupon agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute Agreement and any Disputes.
      </p>
      <p><b>(d) <u>Injunctive Relief</u></b>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Dispute Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property, or any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the security of the Site, and/or any illegal or intentional act against your interests or the general business interests of Groupon.</p>
      <p><b>(e) <u>Severability</u></b>. With the exception of Section 24(b) above, if any part of this Section 24 is ruled to
         be unenforceable, then the balance of this Section 24 shall remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if
         the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein. If Section 24(b) above is ruled to be unenforceable, then
         Section 24(a) shall be deemed unenforceable, but the rest of Section 24 shall remain in full effect.
